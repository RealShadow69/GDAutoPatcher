# GDAutoPatcher
Python Script that can download downgraded Geometry Dash game files from 1.9-2.206 Windows/Linux and MacOS supported
# Disclaimer
This is not piracy you still need to own the game for this to work also do not worry about save coruption as the files have the exe renamed so your game saves in a different folder just copy your save data over 

Also I have no idea if this actually works on Mac

# Usage
Start the script and type a version number to start downloading (also see additional options below) full list of available versions include, 1.9, 2.0, 2.11, 2.204, 2.206 (2.204 doesn't exist on MacOS)
After the download is done unzip the file and start the game then copy your save data over to the new folder created in the localappdata directory
